                    <h3>Subscription, Payments and Refunds</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Subscription</h4>
                            <p>During your subscription to a Subscription Plan, you get a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license from us to access and view the content included in that Subscription Plan.</p>
                            <p>The subscription that you purchase or renew determines the scope, features, and price of your access to a Subscription Plan. You may not transfer, assign, or share your subscription with anyone else.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right to revoke any license to use the content in our Subscription Plans for legal or policy reasons at any time and at our sole discretion, such as if we no longer have the right to offer the content through a Subscription Plan.</p>
                            <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time. If you cancel your subscription to a Subscription Plan, your access to that Subscription Plan will automatically end on the last day of your billing period. On cancellation, you will not be entitled to receive a refund or credit of any fees already paid for your subscription. After cancelation, we may reserve your account data for maximum period of 6 months.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Payments</h4>
                            <p>ARMSTRONG offers paid Services (e.g., Monthly subscription, tool kits) for a fee. You are responsible for paying all fees charged by or for ARMSTRONG and applicable taxes in a timely manner with a payment mechanism associated with the applicable paid Services. If your payment method fails, ARMSTRONG has the right to terminate your account. Fees may vary based on your location and other factors, and ARMSTRONG reserves the right to change any fees at any time at its sole discretion. Any change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting through the relevant Services.</p>
                            <p>We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout). Any price offered for particular content may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available only to new users.</p>
                            <p>If you are logged into your account, the listed currency you see is based on your location when you created your account. If you are not logged into your account, the price currency is based on the country where you are located. We do not enable users to see pricing in other currencies.</p>
                            <p>If you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.</p>
                            <p>Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. To subscribe to a Subscription Plan, you must provide a payment method. By subscribing to a Subscription Plan and providing your billing information during checkout, you grant us and our payment service providers the right to process payment for the then-applicable fees via the payment method we have on record for you. At the end of each subscription term, we will automatically renew your subscription for the same length of term and process your payment method for payment of the then-applicable fees.</p>
                            <p>If we are unable to process payment through the payment method we have on file for you, or if you file a chargeback disputing charges made to your payment method and the chargeback is granted, we may suspend or terminate your subscription.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right to change our Subscription Plans or adjust pricing for our Services at our sole discretion. Any price changes or changes to your subscription will take effect following notice to you.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Refunds</h4>
                            <p>ARMSTRONG does not offer refunds for payments made on a month-month or any periodical subscription plan. Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis unless and until you cancel or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by ARMSTRONG.</p>
                            <p>If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly/periodical period; you will continue to have access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.</p>
                            <p>For the tool kits, if you ordered a toolkit and received it with some parts missing, not functional or damaged then you must notify us through our online support or via no-reply@armstrong.courses within 48 hours from receiving your kit with sending a photos and full description of your claim. Our team will investigate the case and take the appropriate action by guiding you or sending replacements.</p>

                            <h4>Gifts and Promotional Codes</h4>
                            <p>Your subscription may start with a free trial. The duration of the free trial period of your subscription will be specified during sign-up. ARMSTRONG determines free trial eligibility at our sole discretion and may limit eligibility or duration. We reserve the right to terminate the free trial and suspend your subscription if we determine that you aren’t eligible.</p>
                            <p>ARMSTRONG or our partners may offer gift and promotional codes to students. Certain codes may be redeemed for gift or promotional credits applied to your ARMSTRING account, which then may be used on our platform, subject to the terms included with your codes. Other codes may be directly redeemable for specific content. These codes and credits, as well as any promotional value linked to them, may expire if not used within the period specified in your ARMSTRONG account. Gift and promotional codes offered by ARMSTRONG may not be refunded for cash, unless otherwise specified in the terms included with your codes. Gift and promotional codes offered by a partner are subject to that partner’s refund policies. If you have multiple saved credit amounts, ARMSTRONG may determine which of your credits to apply to your purchase.</p>
